        "\n",
        "**Note: this notebook does not require a GPU and can be downloaded and run in jupyter lab.**\n",
        "\n",
        "Partial order planning searches the space of possible plans, looking for one that contains a partially-ordered sequence of actions that transforms an initial state to a state in which a goal situation holds.\n",
        "\n",
        "The initial state is a list of clauses. A clause is a logical predicate of the form `(predicate_name, parameter1, parameter2, ..., parameterN)`. For example, if we wish to express that \"John is at the store\", then we would write `(\"at\", \"john\", \"store\")`. Symbols are strings that are reused and have meaning to the user. The initial state is a list of clauses. Anything that is listed is true in the initial state of the world. Anything that is not in the list can be assumed to be false.\n",
        "\n",
        "A goal is a set of clauses that we want to be true by the end of the plan. Other clauses can be true, but those listed must be true. Clauses in the goal can be of the form given above, but can also include negated clauses `(NOT, (predicate_name, parameter1, parameter2, ... parameterN))`. For example if we what John to not be at the store, then `(NOT, (\"at\", \"john\", \"store))`.\n",
        "\n",
        "Operators are the means by which the state of the world can be changed. Operators are schemas that have N pieces of information:\n",
        " - **name:** the name of the operator (e.g., \"move\")\n",
        " - **vars:** the parameters of the operator (e.g., person, start, destination)\n",
        " - **constraints:** a set of clauses that must be true in the initial state and never change. Constraints are typically clauses about types and imutable properties. For example if want to put constraints on the variables above, we might have e.g., `(\"person\", person), (\"location\", start), (\"location, destination)`. Constraints can also be of the form `(NEQ, var1, var2)` indicating that two variables cannot be bound to the same value. \n",
        " - **pre:** the precondition, the set of clauses that must be true for the operator to be used.\n",
        " - **effect:** the set of clauses that will be true after an operator finishes executing.\n",
        "\n",
        "The planner will figure out which operators to put into the plan. When an operator is instantiated and put into the plan, we refer to it as an \"action\" and the variables in vars, pre, and effect, become \"bound\". A variable is bound when a symbol is assigned to the variable. The plan's \"bindings\" is a dictionary that maps variables to symbols (strings). Actions are instantiated because a goal clause is not satisfied. That is, there is nothing in the plan that makes the clause true. When an action is instantiated into the plan to make a goal clause true, we record that relationship with a *causal link*. A causal link is of the form:\n",
        "```\n",
        "LINK:\n",
        "  source: action_id\n",
        "  target: action_id\n",
        "  clause: clause of the target being satisfied by an effect of source\n",
        "```\n",
        "Actions are also instantiated if any other action has a clause in its precondition that is not satisfied.\n",
        "\n",
        "To make things easier, we convert the initial state into a dummy action (`:init`) in which the action's effect is the list of initial state clauses.\n",
        "We also use a goal dummy action (`:goal`) in which the precondition is the list of goal clauses. The init dummy action creates the initial state with its effects and thus must always be first. The goal dummy action requires all goal clauses and must always be last.\n",
        "\n",
        "Plans also have ordering constraints. Ordering constraints are doubles `(action_id1, action_id2)` indicating that action 1 must be absolutely ordered before action 2.\n",
        "\n",
        "Plans have *flaws*. Flaws are reasons why the plan is not complete. In standard planning, there are two types of flaws:\n",
        " - **Open flaw:** A goal clause or a precondition of an action is unsatisfied. That is, there is no causal link that links that precondition of that action to the effect of an earlier action (or initial state). Open flaws are resolved by adding a new action, finding an existing action with an effect that satisfies the open clause, or linking to the initial state. In reality, all legal options are tried.\n",
        " - **Causal threat:** There is an action with an effect that negates the clause of a causal link and no ordering constraints that prohibit that action from occuring during the causal link. Think of a causal link as a duration in which the clause must remain true. Causal threats are resolved by ordering the threatening action before the duration of the causal link or after. Both are tried.\n",
        "\n",
        "A plan object thus has the following members:\n",
        " - **id:** Each plan has a unique identifier\n",
        " - **actions:** Set of actions (unordered), including the init dummy action and goal dummy action.\n",
        " - **binds:** The variable bindings, a dictionary.\n",
        " - **ordering:** Set of ordering constraints. The ordering constraints partially orders the set of actions.\n",
        " - **links:** Set of causal links.\n",
        " - **flaws:** Set of flaw objects.\n",
        " - **reason:** A data structure that stores information about the reason the plan was created (what flaw was being resolved).\n",
        " - **parent:** A pointer to the parent plan. \n",
        "\n",
        "For debugging help, every plan that gets created is added to a global `ALL_PLANS`. Look at the reason and parents to get a sense of what plans were created and why."
